🎯 Objective

Be the first to complete your legend’s victory conditions and reach the required points before anyone else.
Each legend curses a character, providing buffs and debuffs that shape your strategy.

Example:
The Llorona may increase your attack in rivers but reduce your defense in villages.

Moving strategically across the game board can mean the difference between success and failure in your game plan.
